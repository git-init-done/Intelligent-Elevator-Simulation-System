# Intelligent-Elevator-Simulation-System
Welcome to the Intelligent Elevator Simulation System — a thoughtfully designed, console-based elevator experience built with C++. This project blends object-oriented programming with real-time user interaction to simulate an access-controlled elevator in a multi-floor building. Step into the future of building automation — one floor at a time.
